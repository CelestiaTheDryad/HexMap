-permissions are used to limit a user's interaction with the server and use of commands
-a single permission is made from a tree structure used to organize permissions
--eg, hexmap.commands.addunit could be the permission that lets a user add new units using the default Hexmap add command
-* is a special character used to grant a subjet all permissions in a category
--eg, hexmap.commands.* could be the permission that lets a user use all default Hexmap commands

--- Registering new permissions ---
1. The base permission manager must be obtained from the server
3. The Server.registerPermission() method must be called on the lowest level manager with the new permission's key
4. All steps of a permission must be lowercase a-z characters

--- How permissions are stored ---
This needs to be developed more
1. When a user first connects to the server a premissions/<username>.txt file will be created
2. This file will simply be a list of permissions that apply to that user, with one permission per line
