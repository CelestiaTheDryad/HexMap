-permissions are used to limit a user's interaction with the server and use of commands
-a single permission is made from a tree structure used to organize permissions
--eg, hexmap.commands.addunit could be the permission that lets a user add new units using the default Hexmap add command
-* is a special character used to grant a subjet all permissions in a category
--eg, hexmap.commands.* could be the permission that lets a user use all default Hexmap commands

--- Registering new permissions ---
1. The base permission manager must be obtained from the server
3. The Server.registerPermission() method must be called on the lowest level manager with the new permission's key
4. All steps of a permission must be lowercase a-z characters

--- How permissions are stored ---
1. When a user connects to the server a premissions/<username>.txt file will be loaded
	1a. If that file does not exist, user has no special permissions and will use the default group
2. The first line in this file is the filename for the group this user belongs to, eg "admin.txt"
3. Group permission files are stored in permissions/groups, in the same format as user permission files, minus the group header
4. This file will simply be a list of permissions that apply to that user, with one permission per line
