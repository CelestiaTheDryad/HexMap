- commands are indicated by messages starting with a "/"
- the "/" is optional when entered from the server console
- the "name" of a command is it's first string delimited by the space character
- eg "/add foo bar baz" would have a name of "add"

*** Registering Commands ***
1. A class extending HexCommand must be implemented
2. RegisterCommand must be called on the server with an instance of that command
3. That command must have a unique name to be registered

*** Applying Commands ***
1. use server side command processing for security and reliability
2. client sends a commandMessage to the server
3. server processes commandMessage, makes sure it has a valid name
	3a. if name is valid, apply it. Individual command handlers are responsible for checking the validity of subsequent command parts
	3b. if the name is invalid, send a message to the client to notify them
